- What is the goal of your website? (Think in terms of your user -- why might they visit your site?)

    I want to show case some of the work I've done throughout college as I'm graduating this semester. I think it would be cool to get a static website where others can view my work.

- Why is responsive web design important? 

    Responsive web design is critical because today more than ever there are so many different devices that can access the internet. Specifically, mobile devices make up a large portion of users that access websites as almost everyone has a phone now days. Having a website that is responsive to both mobile devices and web is very important for great user experience.
