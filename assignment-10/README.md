- Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?

    The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name. Class selector will only style elements in HTML where the element class is defined as the css style. The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. The universal selects all HTML elements on the page.

- Discuss your color palette. How did you choose your colors?

    For my color palette, I've always been more of a fan of light color themes and so I tested and tried various color combinations to see what looked the best to my eyes. I didn't want a plain white background, but wanted to retain a light background, so I opted for a light creme colored background. For the navigation bar I decided on a blue-ish / lavender color and thought it played well with the background color. 

- Optional: discuss any challenges you faced this week, and how you overcame them.

    It took a little bit of time to refresh myself with css, but once I got going it was fairly straight forward to adjust and style things. I think the hardest part was the trial and error and the pipeline to see if the changes worked or not (since github pages can take a while to reflect changes) and so I used a lot of time in waiting.
