Web browsers function by presenting web resources to you (user) by sending requests(uri/ url) from servers and displaying the resource in the browser window. Resources are usually in HTML, but can be in other formats such as images, PDFs, etc. 

Web browsers that I use are Google Chrome, Safari, and Brave.
