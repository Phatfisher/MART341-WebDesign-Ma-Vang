-  How did your user testing sessions go?

   My user testing was good, it was pretty straight forward with testing. When I did the user testing, my website was still pretty bare in information so there wasn't a whole lot to review other than a couple of sections. But my users really liked the site and thought it was modern and minimalistic. 

- What changes (if any) did you make to your website based on the user feedback you received?

    Both users that tested my website at the time thought the "Scroll to learn more" on the initial landing page was a button. So I need to change that into text and not in a pill element. Additionally both users thought that there should be more information whether that be a resume section / page or listing of skills in technology section and highlighting of some of my projects / work.
