3. Do you have a favorite artistic medium? Why is it your favorite?

	I'm not a artistic person persay in traditional arts and crafts. But I really do enjoy making mobile applications and websites look appealing if that is a valid artistic medium. Making websites and mobile apps look good in design is appealing to me because like other creative mediums there's so many ways to solve a single problem. It also is very challenging to design a great website, which makes it even more fun.
