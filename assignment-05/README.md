# Assignment-05

A website that I visted with the The Wayback Machine was to the year of 2005 and to koa.com. For work I work partially on some minor web development on koa.com and going back to see how websites and how koa.com looked back then is eye opening how far design has come in the last ~15 years. The older design was very basic in design and with your fundemental HTML. Compared to now, changes have seen to really make use of CSS frameworks to beautify things on webspages.
